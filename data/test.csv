" happiness is a fuzzy concept and can mean many different things to many people. Part of the challenge of a science of happiness is to identify different concepts of happiness, and where applicable, split them into their components. Related concepts are well-being, quality of life and flourishing. At least one author defines happiness as contentment.[6] Some commentators focus on the difference between the hedonistic tradition of seeking pleasant and avoiding unpleasant experiences, and the eudaimonic tradition of living life in a full and deeply satisfying way.[7]",enjoy_the_moment

Weare starting a new series on the Buffer blog today with great tips and insights from Joel, CEO here at Buffer. Joel will share his ideas and insights about lifehacking, building a business and working on company culture. Here is #1:
Today itas a little over three years since I first had the idea for Buffer, and with the year and a half before that which I worked on my previous startup, Iave started to notice a few patterns amongst the ups and downs that come with building a startup.
One of the most important things Iave learned during this time is that I perform the best when Iam happy. It really does change everything. If Iam happy then Iam more productive when hacking code, Iam better at answering support, and I find it easier to stay focused.
Iave found that there are a few key habits which, for me, act as great rituals for enabling me to be consistently happy. They also act as anchor activities to bring my happiness level back up quickly whenever I have a period where Iam not feeling 100%. So here are 6 of the things I do:
1. Wake up early
One of the things I love about running my own startup is that I have complete freedom to experiment with my daily routine.
Through experimentation, Iave found that waking up early every day makes me feel most invigorated and happy. It gives me a great start to the day, and this almost always leads to a great rest of the day. Over time, Iave found I crave that early morning feeling, a time I can do some great work and be super focused. Gretchen Rubin from The Happiness Project mentioned something similar a recent article:
aI get up at 6:00 a.m. every day, even on weekends and vacation, because I love it.a
Waking up early every day requires discipline, especially about what time I sleep. Right now, I have a sleep ritual of disengaging from the day at 9:30pm and sleeping at 10pm. I now love all aspects of this ritual and with it in place I awake at 6am feeling fresh.
The power with your mornings is that you will have about 25,000 of them in your life, so thereas a lot of room to experiment.
2. Exercise daily
aWe found that people who are more physically active have more pleasant-activated feelings than people who are less activea a Amanda Hyde
In the last three years, Iave gone from dabbling with exercise to it becoming something I do every weekday without fail. At first I had no idea what to do at the gym, so I asked my brother, whoas a personal trainer. I then went a few times with a good friend and soon I was hooked.
Over time, I developed this into a daily ritual so strong that I feel a pull towards it, and by doing it consistently I feel fantastic and can more easily take on other challenges. I recently discovered that exercise is a keystone habit which paves the way for growth in all other areas. Iave also found that it helps me to get high quality sleep each night.
3. Have a habit of disengagement
aThe richest, happiest and most productive lives are characterized by the ability to fully engage in the challenge at hand, but also to disengage periodically and seek renewal a Loehr and Schwarz, The Power of Full Engagement
As I mentioned earlier, a key way I am able to wake up at 6am is through my ritual of disengaging in the evening. I go for a walk at 9:30pm, along a route which Iave done many times before. Since the route is already decided and is the same every time, I am simply walking and doing nothing else. This prompts reflection and relaxation.",achievement

"The last small thing that made me surprisingly happy was spending time with my grandma.I went through a phase in my life where I wanted complete autonomy from my family. I felt crushed by the pressures of trying to pursue a career my family wanted from me rather than one I wanted for myself. So, I just wanted to break free from all of them and be as far away as I possibly could, even my grandma whom has been there for me every day for the first 12 years of my life.It wasn't until lately, that I realized the importance of family and how short life can be. My grandma is 96 years old, which means she has a limited time left on this beautiful planet. It made me really sad that I haven't made much effort to really spend time with her ever since she moved to her own home. Instead of spending my weekends with her, I chose to go out with friends, date around, sit at home on the computer browsing new music, and basically just waste my time.This weekend, I decided to change that. I called her and spent the entire day with her. Sunday morning, I came to her house, cooked us some pancakes (her favorite), we went to Temple, just like we did when I was a kid, and then we spent the rest of the day at the mall, browsing the stores. I didn't expect it to make me as happy as I had planned, but it really made my day. I'm really glad I did that and I certainly plan to spend a lot more time with her now.",affection

"The last small thing that made me surprisingly happy was spending time with my grandma.I went through a phase in my life where I wanted complete autonomy from my family. I felt crushed by the pressures of trying to pursue a career my family wanted from me rather than one I wanted for myself. So, I just wanted to break free from all of them and be as far away as I possibly could, even my grandma whom has been there for me every day for the first 12 years of my life.It wasn't until lately, that I realized the importance of family and how short life can be. My grandma is 96 years old, which means she has a limited time left on this beautiful planet. It made me really sad that I haven't made much effort to really spend time with her ever since she moved to her own home. Instead of spending my weekends with her, I chose to go out with friends, date around, sit at home on the computer browsing new music, and basically just waste my time.This weekend, I decided to change that. I called her and spent the entire day with her. Sunday morning, I came to her house, cooked us some pancakes (her favorite), we went to Temple, just like we did when I was a kid, and then we spent the rest of the day at the mall, browsing the stores. I didn't expect it to make me as happy as I had planned, but it really made my day. I'm really glad I did that and I certainly plan to spend a lot more time with her now.",affection
