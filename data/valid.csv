"The last small thing that made me surprisingly happy was spending time with my grandma.I went through a phase in my life where I wanted complete autonomy from my family. I felt crushed by the pressures of trying to pursue a career my family wanted from me rather than one I wanted for myself. So, I just wanted to break free from all of them and be as far away as I possibly could, even my grandma whom has been there for me every day for the first 12 years of my life.It wasn't until lately, that I realized the importance of family and how short life can be. My grandma is 96 years old, which means she has a limited time left on this beautiful planet. It made me really sad that I haven't made much effort to really spend time with her ever since she moved to her own home. Instead of spending my weekends with her, I chose to go out with friends, date around, sit at home on the computer browsing new music, and basically just waste my time.This weekend, I decided to change that. I called her and spent the entire day with her. Sunday morning, I came to her house, cooked us some pancakes (her favorite), we went to Temple, just like we did when I was a kid, and then we spent the rest of the day at the mall, browsing the stores. I didn't expect it to make me as happy as I had planned, but it really made my day. I'm really glad I did that and I certainly plan to spend a lot more time with her now.",affection

"Somehow I ended up with the best parents in the world. Iave always been grateful to have them, and I know that Iam the badass I am today in large part because of them.

Most people would consider themselves fortunate to have great parents. However, I ended up with the coolest grandparents ever, as well. My last living grandparent died more than 16 years ago, but I think of all of them often.

But I never had the opportunity to meet one of my grandparents. My dadas mom, Florence, died in 1979, six years before I was born. My grandpa George remarried shortly after my birth, and his second wife, a saintly, kind woman named Marie, became my grandma, and I loved her as much as all of my biological grandparents.

Iave often wondered about Grandma Florence though.
She was just fifty-seven years old when she died, and Iam ashamed to say that I donat remember if it was from ovarian cancer or cervical cancer. I think ovarian. Whatever the cause, she died way too young.

But just because I never met her doesnat mean that she hasnt had an impact on my life. She has probably impacted my life more than any other person who Iave never met. That might not make sense, but let me explain.

I donat remember how old I was when I learned that Grandpa George had a wife, and my dad had a mom, who Iad never met. I suspect I was six or seven-years-old, but I donat remember learning that information for the first time. It seems like something I always knew, even though Iam sure it isnat.

I remember seeing pictures of her, and once visiting her grave. My sisteras middle name is Florence, and I knew why.

The earliest impact that I recall Grandma Florence having on my life came one rainy night when I was nine or ten-years-old. My dad, my two sisters and I were in the car and joking around. I donat remember what we were talking about, but at some point the conversation turned to wishes. If we could have just one wish, what would it be?

Iam sure my sisters and I wished for common kid stuff: a million dollars, school to be canceled, a TV in my room. Real dumb stuff to waste a wish on.

And then we asked my dad what head wish for. And he said, aI wish my mom was still alive so she could meet you guys and see how proud I am of you.a

Holy cow.

The joking atmosphere in the car immediately became more somber, and I donat remember if any of us said anything. But I remember thinking to myself, aHe sure must love us if heas going to use his one wish for that.a

I knew he loved us. Despite his occasional moodiness, none of us ever questioned that we were the most important part of his life. He and my mom told us they loved us often, and that they were glad to have us. But his wish just seemed to kick things up a notch.

Since that night, whenever I think of Grandma Florence I think of that conversation in the car, and Iam reminded once again just how much my parents love us. And that never ending, unconditional love has provided so much support for me over the years that I have no doubt itas the foundation of every single positive thing I do in my life.

I think itas also the reason that I feel such a devotion to my kids and to my wife. I know how it feels to never have to wonder if anyone loves you completely and unconditionally. Iave known that all my life. And I want them to know it, also. I never want them to wonder if thereas anyone who loves them so completely.

In sixty-two days, on August 10, it will be the 100th anniversary of Grandma Florenceas birth. I donat know if anyone else has plans to celebrate it, but in my house well get an ice cream cake, and well sing Happy Birthday. And Iall tell my kids the few things I know about Grandma Florence, and Iall tell them the story of that night in the car.

And Iall do my best to make them feel as loved as I did when I heard my dadas wish.",affection

My story began as an ordinary boy in the state of Ferndale, Michigan. I am the youngest of five siblings, a son of Sazelia and Marvin Johnson.

My mother was a university woman who tries to acquire a bachelor's degree in Business at the University of Michigan. My father was a Mechanical Engineer who is deeply fascinated with cars. My parents are intellectual and social creatures who passed down the essential values of hard work, education and religion to their children. They make sure that we are not deprived of the essential things that we need in our education. They also impart important attitudes and ethical standards needed in conforming well to our social environment.

So, the graduation ceremony was in the main auditorium of the university and everyone was there, all the students, faculty members and of course family and other invited guests. There were the usual speeches, presentation of degrees to graduates and a few other things which the faculty had organized, and then after we organized a big lunch.

There was my own family and three of my friends and their families as well, so it was quite an occasion. We had this family lunch at a local restaurant which we had booked for the afternoon. It was a really special time having all the most important people in my life together at the same time.

Later on, when the family members had left we went out to a bar and had a few beers together just me and my friends. Looking back on it now, it was one of the happiest days of my life I think a we all felt like we had really achieved something graduating and that particular day was really good for all of us.
